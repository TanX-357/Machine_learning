In this project,the objective was to detect suspicious vessels as submarines or not.The strength of Ultrasonic wave reflections at different angles were used as features.
I used random forest algorithm(creating multiple datasets from single one by randomly duplicating few of the examples of the dataset),tuning the hyper parameter(which was no of multiple datasets to be created from the original one) through coarse grain search.The accuracy achieved was more than 90% on the testing data set.
