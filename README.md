# Machine_learning
It consists of bunch of different Kaggle problem sets and the most suitable Machine Learning algorithm for that problem(w.r.t accuracy matrix). 
All major ML algos used have been implemented from scratch involving hyperparameter and parameter tuning with accuracy comparable to the inbuilt sklearn classifier
..ex-SVMs,Naive Bayes,Decision Trees,Random Forest,K-NN,Decision trees regression etc
